An implementation of support vector machines (SVM) using C++ was developed from scratch. 
Additionally, a Python interface was created to mimic the interface offered by scikit-learn for SVM. 
The algorithm from the paper "Sequential Minimal Optimization: A Fast Algorithm for Training Support Vector Machines" was employed for solving the dual problem.
